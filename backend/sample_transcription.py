    "text": " Senator Paul raised the issue about money and so forth. And I look at it, uh, his questions are valid, but I look at it a slightly different way. I am concerned and you correct me if I'm wrong here. Uh, Modano, who helped create one of the important vaccines that is saving lives received as I recall about two and a half billion dollars, I think, during the Trump administration. My understanding and you correct me if I am wrong is that the gentleman who is the head or was the head of Modano recently received a golden parachute of some 800 million dollars to 1.5 billion of federal funding to develop the drug. Moderna makes huge amounts of money. This guy receives 800 million gold in gold and parachute. Am I right about that? I'm not aware of that. It's not something I would keep up with, particularly in this job. Not something you would keep up with. Uh, the head of the food and drug administration, you would not be concerned that a guy, when we're producing, trying to get vaccines out to people, it was, it was, I'm correct, it is a 926 million dollar golden parachute. If that's true, if the federal government gives a company to 1.5 billion dollars and short time later, the head of the company gets a 900 million dollar golden parachute that is not a concern to you. I didn't say it was not a concern. I said it's not something I keep up with in daily life. What I'm very concerned about is the equitable, equitable distribution of vaccines that save lives and anti-varrals that save lives. And we're not reaching the goals that we need at the time. Well, maybe, you know, I think we need, I would hope everybody agrees that we need the financial resources to make sure that everybody has the vaccines. But if one guy ends up with 900 million dollars rather than using that money to get out the medicine we need the vaccines, we need out to the people doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Thank you very much.",

And I look at it, uh, his questions are valid, but I look at it a slightly different way. I am concerned and you correct me if I'm wrong here. Uh, Modano, who helped create one of the important vaccines that is saving lives received as I recall about two and a half billion dollars, I think, during the Trump administration. My understanding and you correct me if I am wrong is that the gentleman who is the head or was the head of Modano recently received a golden parachute of some 800 million dollars to 1.5 billion of federal funding to develop the drug. Moderna makes huge amounts of money. This guy receives 800 million gold in gold and parachute. Am I right about that? I'm not aware of that. It's not something I would keep up with, particularly in this job. Not something you would keep up with. Uh, the head of the food and drug administration, you would not be concerned that a guy, when we're producing, trying to get vaccines out to people, it was, it was, I'm correct, it is a 926 million dollar golden parachute. If that's true, if the federal government gives a company to 1.5 billion dollars and short time later, the head of the company gets a 900 million dollar golden parachute that is not a concern to you. I didn't say it was not a concern. I said it's not something I keep up with in daily life. What I'm very concerned about is the equitable, equitable distribution of vaccines that save lives and anti-varrals that save lives. And we're not reaching the goals that we need at the time. Well, maybe, you know, I think we need, I would hope everybody agrees that we need the financial resources to make sure that everybody has the vaccines. But if one guy ends up with 900 million dollars rather than using that money to get out the medicine we need the vaccines, we need out to the people doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Thank you very much.\n\n    Your analysis should be no more than 3–4 sentences and should point out stuttering, filler words, and any incoherent or unclear sections.\n     The transcript contains several issues that could improve its clarity, cohesiveness, and organization.
